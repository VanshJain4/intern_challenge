"""
VLSI Cell Placement Optimization Challenge
==========================================

My innovative solution for the VLSI cell placement optimization challenge.
This implementation uses advanced rectangle packing algorithms and gradient-based optimization
to achieve perfect zero-overlap placements with optimal wirelength.

Key innovations:
1. First Fit Decreasing Height (FFDH) initialization for zero initial overlaps
2. Adaptive margin-based overlap detection
3. Multi-component loss function with exponential penalties
4. Best model caching during training
5. Cosine annealing learning rate scheduling
