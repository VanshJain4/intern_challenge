Issues Log - VLSI Cell Placement Optimization Challenge
======================================================

PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED:
1. Initial overlap_repulsion_loss() function was not implemented (placeholder returned constant loss)
2. Tensor type issues with PyTorch operations (float vs Tensor in exp() functions)
3. Deprecated verbose parameter in ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler
4. High learning rates causing optimization instability
5. Poor initial cell placement leading to excessive overlaps

SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED:
1. Implemented efficient vectorized overlap detection using broadcasting operations:
   - Used pairwise distance matrices with unsqueeze for broadcasting
   - Applied ReLU for differentiable overlap calculation
   - Used upper triangular masking to avoid double counting
   - Added adaptive penalty factor for faster convergence

2. Fixed tensor type issues by converting float values to tensors before PyTorch operations

3. Removed deprecated verbose parameter from learning rate scheduler

4. Tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance:
   - Learning rate: 0.08 (increased from 0.01)
   - Lambda overlap: 100.0 (increased from 10.0)
   - Epochs: 3000 (increased from 1000)
   - Added adaptive learning rate scheduling

5. Improved initial placement strategy:
   - Replaced random circular placement with grid-based initialization
   - Calculated optimal spread radius based on total cell area
   - Added small random offsets to break symmetry

6. Enhanced optimization strategy:
   - Added learning rate scheduling with ReduceLROnPlateau
   - Implemented adaptive gradient clipping
   - Added exponential decay for overlap weight (aggressive early, balanced later)
   - Used Adam optimizer with momentum

FINAL RESULTS (Official Test Suite) - LATEST:
========================================
**MASSIVE BREAKTHROUGH - 99.6% IMPROVEMENT!**

- Average Overlap: 0.0033 (99.6% better than baseline 0.8!)
- Average Wirelength: 1.0971 (competitive)
- Total Runtime: 130.14s for 10 test cases
- **9/10 tests achieved PERFECT ZERO overlap elimination!**
- Only test 10 (2010 cells) has minimal overlap: 0.0328 (66/2010 cells = 3.28%)

LEADERBOARD COMPARISON:
- âœ… CRUSHED partcl baseline (0.8 overlap) - 99.6% better
- âœ… BEAT Prithvi Seran (0.0499 overlap) - 93.4% better  
- ðŸŽ¯ Close to Akash Pai (0.0006 overlap) - need 82% more improvement
- ðŸŽ¯ Approaching Neel Shah (0.0000 overlap) - near perfect

TEST BREAKDOWN:
- Tests 1-9: PERFECT (0.0000 overlap each) âœ“âœ“âœ“
- Test 10 (2010 cells): 0.0328 overlap (needs more training)

TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS (Latest Iteration):
===========================================
1. **Multi-Component Overlap Loss:**
   - Linear penalty (basic overlap area)
   - Quadratic penalty (L2 for stronger gradients)
   - Cubic penalty (VERY strong for large overlaps)
   - Count penalty (number of overlapping pairs)
   - Exponential penalty (with safe clamping to prevent overflow)
   - Combined weight: 20L + 100Q + 200CÂ³ + 50count + 10exp

2. **Adaptive Hyperparameters by Problem Size:**
   - Small (<50 cells): 6K epochs, lr=0.12, overlap_weight=1500
   - Medium (<150 cells): 10K epochs, lr=0.10, overlap_weight=2500
   - Large (<500 cells): 12K epochs, lr=0.08, overlap_weight=3000
   - X-Large (2000+ cells): 20K epochs, lr=0.06, overlap_weight=5000

3. **Intelligent Initialization:**
   - Grid-based placement with generous spacing (2.5x avg cell size)
   - Cells sorted by size (largest first) for better packing
   - Random offsets to break symmetry

4. **Multi-Phase Training:**
   - Phase 1 (0-30%): Aggressive overlap elimination
   - Phase 2 (30-70%): Balanced optimization
   - Phase 3 (70-100%): Wirelength focus if overlaps eliminated

5. **Robust Early Stopping:**
   - Adaptive patience based on problem size (600-1500 epochs)
   - Zero overlap detection with stability check (100+ epochs)
   - Prevents premature convergence on local minima

6. **Numerical Stability:**
   - NaN detection and prevention in loss calculations
   - Gradient clipping (adaptive 1.5-3.0 max norm)
   - Safe clamping in exponential penalties
   - detach() for evaluation to prevent gradient tracking issues
